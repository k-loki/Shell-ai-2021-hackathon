The story:

 - Shell.ai is a company focused on producing renewable and sustainable Energy. It got some solar energy plants.
- But there are problems with solar Energy the sky can be cloudy or it may be raining or the weather is stormy, In these type of conditions the output of energy     
  produced may drastically go down.
- But our clients (shellai consumers) don't want drop in their energy consumption.
- So to manage the fluctuations in the energy output, we need to figure out the cloud cover in the future.
- This is where we as Data scientists come in, In this challenge we help shell.ai predict the cloud cover in the next 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min.
- These predictions may help the company cushion the impact of energy fluctuations.

My thoughts and approaches:
 -
